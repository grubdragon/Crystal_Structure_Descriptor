# Project 2 - Machine Learning

## Code Guide

DOs:
* Use relevant variable and function names
* Break commits into small pieces
* Write descriptive(very important) but small commit messages.
* Break up notebooks into small cells(smaller the better). Try to stick to 2-3 lines. Note: This is a loose guide, some cases call for larger cell sizes BUT should be avoided.
* When writing functions:
    * Look for a similar function in the repo. If you can make-do with small config details, use it!
    * Write your own function and add it to the helpers in an existing folder
    * Modify existing functions available in the repo, if necessary, and fix all files that are affected by the change in the VERY NEXT commit.
* Make configurable, general functions. eg. How commits on loading positive and negative files were unified.

DON'Ts
* Add data/pickle files in the repository
* Make bogus commits. Keep commit history clean. (eg. Adding and removing files back to back should be avoided) This increases repo size and adds redundant lines in the commit history. 
* Put anything in the root folder other than notebooks
* Commiting multiple files in the same commit.
